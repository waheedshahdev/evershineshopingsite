# Evershine Shopping

**Evershine Shopping** is a feature-rich **eCommerce platform** developed in **CodeIgniter** and **MySQL**, designed for boutiques and fashion retailers in Pakistan that specialize in **unstitched suits**.  
The platform enables customers to explore collections, customize their fabric orders, and place purchases online, while providing administrators with full control over inventory, orders, and payments.

---

## 🛍️ Overview

In the Pakistani fashion industry, **unstitched suits** are sold as fabrics that customers later get tailored — meaning every order may need **custom measurements, notes, or design preferences**.  
Generic eCommerce systems fail to address this unique workflow.  
**Evershine Shopping** was therefore built as a **customized platform** that supports unstitched product management, fabric-specific attributes, and order customization fields.

**Key Purpose:**  
To digitize boutique operations and allow buyers to select, customize, and order unstitched clothing online, with flexibility for personalized instructions.

**Tech Stack**
- Framework: **CodeIgniter (PHP MVC)**
- Database: **MySQL**
- Frontend: **Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, jQuery**
- Hosting: **Apache / Shared Hosting (Pakistan)**
- Payment Methods: **Cash on Delivery (COD)** & **Bank Transfer**

**Developed by:** *Waheed Shah — Software Engineer*

## 💡 Why It Was Developed

Unlike ready-made garments, **unstitched suits require customization** — each customer may request specific adjustments, color combinations, or fabric detailing.  
Evershine Shopping was developed to **bridge the gap between fabric retailers and customers** who needed a way to purchase fabrics online **while still providing personalized tailoring preferences**.  

This unique requirement led to building a **custom CodeIgniter platform**, allowing flexibility, fast database operations, and easy backend control for local shop owners.
